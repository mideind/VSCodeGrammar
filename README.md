# Syntax highlighting for .grammar files

This extension shows .grammar files with nice syntax coloring in VSCode.

## Installation

You can manually install a VS Code extension packaged in a .vsix file using the
Install from VSIX command in the Extensions view command dropdown, or the
Extensions: Install from VSIX command in the Command Palette. Just point to the .vsix file
included in this repository.

Alternatively, copy `syntaxes/grammar.tmLanguage` to your `.vscode` configuration
directory:

```
cp syntaxes/grammar.tmLanguage ~/.vscode/extensions/VSCodeGrammar/syntaxes/
```
